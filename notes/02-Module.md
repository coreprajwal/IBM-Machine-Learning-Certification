# ðŸ“˜ Module 2: Linear and Logistic Regression

> ðŸ§  Summary:  


## ðŸ§© what is regression?
- linear regression is supervised learning model
- it models a relationship between continuos independent and dependent feature
  
## Types of regression
- Single regression  
- Multiple regression 

## ðŸ§  Compare Single and Multiple Regression
single regression has one independent feature
Multiple regression has many independent features

## ðŸ§  Machine Learning Techniques:-


## ðŸ’¡Applications of Regression
sales prediction
Price estimation
Predictive maintainance
Employment income
Rainfall estimation
Spread of infectious diesease


## Regression Algorithms :-
1.Linear and polynomial regression
2.Random Forest
3.Extreme Gradient Boosting (XG Boost)
4.K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) Algorithm
5.Support Vector Machines
6.Neural Network

## What is actually a Simple Linear Regression ?\
- Single independent feature corresponds to single dependent feature
- eg:- engine size and co2 emmision

## How single Linear Regression Work?
- you take independent variable , calculate the co2 emmision by using linear regression formula, which is y=0o + 01x (predicted value)
- we calculate difference between actual and predicted for a single point that is the error, then on performing summation of every error on every point and taking its average we get mean error of the whole single linear regression
- we find the best fit line which has least MSE and its called ols regression
  
## why it fails?
- Outliers reduces its accuracy way too much
- Linear model is too simple to capture complexities
