ðŸ§  Summary:  


## ðŸ§© Concept of clustering and applications
- clustering basically, forms clusters of similar type of data
- it is used in user segmentation, anomaly detection etc

## ðŸ§  Apply k-means clustering to segment customers based on characteristics
- In k-means clustering k no. of clusters are creted based on similarity 

## ðŸ§  Explain different types of clustering ,including partition,density and heirarchical
- density based clustering form separate clusters based on different density and are circular in shape
- partition based clustering has different python functions such make blob and make moon , on which it does partition


## ðŸ§  Analyze agglomerative and divisive hierarchical clustering, along with their approaches to grouping data points

- Agglomerative hierarchical clustering is a bottom-up aproach, it forms small clusters and forms relationship with other other small clusters to create a bigger clusters
- it is shown with dendrogram
- it measures distance between two points , takes least distance and forms cluster then mean is taken and from that point distance of other points is taken and thus form all relations and clusters

- devisive hierarchical clustering is a top-down aproach , at first it takes whole as single clusters and then find sub clusters and make relations
- it is also shown with dendrogram
